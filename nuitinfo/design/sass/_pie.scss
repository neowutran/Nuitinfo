// It is suggested that you use Sass's @extend directive to apply the PIE
// behavior to your elements. Setting this variable will tell the `pie` mixin
// to extend it. Or you can just extend the base class yourself.
$pie-base-class : pie-element;

// There are two approaches to creating PIE elements
// The default approach is to make the element position: relative.
.pie-element
{
  // relative is the default, so passing relative
  // is redundant, but we do it here for clarity.
  @include pie-element(relative);
}

.bordered
{
  @include pie;
  // Because $pie-base-class is set, this results in an extend of .pie-element.
  @include border-radius(5px);
}

.gradient
{
  @include pie;
  // Because $pie-base-class is set, this results in an extend of .pie-element.
  @include background(linear-gradient(#ff0000, #0000ff));
}

// But sometimes this messes up your positioning
// So you can also use z-indexing. In this case
// an ancestor element before or having the first
// opaque background should be marked as a pie-container
// which gives it a z-index of 0 (actually any z-index
// can be provided to the pie-container mixin).
// And then the pie element itself should be given
// a z-index of -1.
.pie-container
{
  @include pie-container;
}

.z-pie-element
{
  // this will get a z-index of 0, you can pass a z-index value if you want
  @include pie-element(z-index);
}

// This is just a simple example of how to use the z-index approach.
.widget
{
  @extend .pie-container;
  h3
  {
    @include pie(z-pie-element);
    // This will extend .z-pie-element instead of .pie-element
  }
}

// Lastly, you can just include the pie-element mixin directly if you need to do a one-off:
.has-gradient
{
  @include pie-element(relative);
  @include background(linear-gradient(#ff0000, #0000ff));
}
